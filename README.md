## Simple-Calculator
This is a basic calculator project created using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to perform essential arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project focuses on DOM manipulation to handle user input and update the display dynamically.

# Features
- Basic math operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Includes a decimal button that displays results up to the hundredths place
- Clear button: resets the display and all stored values
- Supports chained calculations: continues operations using the last result
- Error handling:
    - Displays a custom error for division by zero
    - Prevents evaluation without complete input (two numbers and an operator)
- Responsive display updates:
    - Results replace the previous display value
    - Starting new input after a result clears the display automatically

# What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to manage calculator logic using JavaScript by creating and connecting functions for basic math operations while handling state across user inputs. I gained experience working with dynamic displays, updating the content in real time based on user actions. I practiced input validation techniques to prevent invalid operations, such as blocking multiple decimals or handling divide-by-zero errors. Additionally, I implemented user-friendly features like backspace, clear, and chaining calculations, making the calculator feel more complete and functional. This project also helped me understand how to format results for readability, round decimals appropriately, and incorporate keyboard support to improve overall usability.
